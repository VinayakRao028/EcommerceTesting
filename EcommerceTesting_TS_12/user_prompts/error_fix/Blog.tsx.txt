<Error_encountered>
    After implementing the recommended changes, I have encountered this issue
    The error check script encountered issues with installing Node.js and npm, which are required dependencies for the target code. Additionally, the target code contains several potential undeclared variables and functions, such as 'React.FC', 'section', 'div', 'className', 'img', 'src', 'alt', 'Link', 'to', 'i', 'className', and more. These issues need to be addressed to ensure the code runs correctly.

    Suggest me a precise and finite solution to this issue,
    I have attached the relevant Directory Structure also to give you the required context regarding the folder structure.

    <DirectoryStruct>
    
    </DirectoryStruct>
