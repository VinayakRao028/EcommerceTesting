<Error_encountered>
    After implementing the recommended changes, I have encountered this issue
    The error check script encountered issues during the installation of Node.js and npm. The script was unable to install the required dependencies for npm, leading to unmet dependencies. Additionally, the Vitest configuration file and the target code appear to be correct and pass the Vitest tests.

    Suggest me a precise and finite solution to this issue,
    I have attached the relevant Directory Structure also to give you the required context regarding the folder structure.

    <DirectoryStruct>
    
    </DirectoryStruct>
