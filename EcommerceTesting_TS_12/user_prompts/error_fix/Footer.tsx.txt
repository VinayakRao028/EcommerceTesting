<Error_encountered>
    After implementing the recommended changes, I have encountered this issue
    The error check script encountered issues installing Node.js and npm, which are required dependencies for running the Vitest tests. The script was unable to resolve the unmet dependencies for the nodejs and npm packages. Additionally, the Vitest test execution reported syntax errors or undeclared variables/functions in the target code (error_check_Footer_33d21f4a-de64-4ffa-b5ac-e293512888fc.tsx).

    Suggest me a precise and finite solution to this issue,
    I have attached the relevant Directory Structure also to give you the required context regarding the folder structure.
