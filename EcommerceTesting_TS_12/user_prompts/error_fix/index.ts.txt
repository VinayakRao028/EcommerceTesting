<Error_encountered>
    After implementing the recommended changes, I have encountered this issue
    The error check script encountered issues during the installation of Node.js and npm. The script attempted to install Node.js and npm, but the installation failed due to unmet dependencies. The output indicates that the nodejs package conflicts with the npm package, and the npm package has several unmet dependencies. Additionally, the script detected syntax errors or undeclared variables/functions in the target code.

    Suggest me a precise and finite solution to this issue,
    I have attached the relevant Directory Structure also to give you the required context regarding the folder structure.

    <DirectoryStruct>
    
    </DirectoryStruct>
