<Error_encountered>
    After implementing the recommended changes, I have encountered this issue
    The error check script encountered issues during the installation of Node.js and npm. The script failed to resolve the unmet dependencies for the npm package, which is required for the installation to complete successfully. The detailed error message indicates that the npm package depends on several other packages that could not be installed, leading to the overall installation failure.

    Suggest me a precise and finite solution to this issue,
    I have attached the relevant Directory Structure also to give you the required context regarding the folder structure.

    <DirectoryStruct>
    
    </DirectoryStruct>
