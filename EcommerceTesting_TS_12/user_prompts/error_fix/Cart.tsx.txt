<Error_encountered>
    After implementing the recommended changes, I have encountered this issue
    The error check script encountered issues during the installation of Node.js and npm. The script failed to resolve the unmet dependencies for the nodejs and npm packages, which prevented the successful installation. The detailed error messages indicate that the nodejs package conflicts with the npm package, and the npm package has several unmet dependencies on other node-related packages that could not be installed.

    Suggest me a precise and finite solution to this issue,
    I have attached the relevant Directory Structure also to give you the required context regarding the folder structure.

    <DirectoryStruct>
    
    </DirectoryStruct>
