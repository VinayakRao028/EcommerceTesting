<Error_encountered>
    After implementing the recommended changes, I have encountered this issue
    The error check script encountered issues during the installation of Node.js and npm. The script was unable to resolve the unmet dependencies for the npm package, which is required for the installation to complete successfully. Additionally, the target code did not contain any syntax errors or undeclared variables/functions.

    Suggest me a precise and finite solution to this issue,
    I have attached the relevant Directory Structure also to give you the required context regarding the folder structure.

    <DirectoryStruct>
    
    </DirectoryStruct>
    </Error_encountered>
