<Error_encountered>
    After implementing the recommended changes, I have encountered this issue
    The error check script encountered issues during the installation of Node.js and npm. The script was unable to install the required dependencies for npm, such as node-cacache, node-gyp, node-mkdirp, node-nopt, node-tar, and node-which. This indicates a problem with the package dependencies that needs to be resolved before the script can successfully run the TypeScript syntax check and linting.

    Suggest me a precise and finite solution to this issue,
    I have attached the relevant Directory Structure also to give you the required context regarding the folder structure.

    <DirectoryStruct>
    
    </DirectoryStruct>
