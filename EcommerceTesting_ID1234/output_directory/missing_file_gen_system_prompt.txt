            - For backend code, implement Swagger documentation for all API endpoints.
            - Validate the code against the target language's best practices and conventions.
            - Document any significant changes with comments in the code.
            - List any new packages, libraries, or modules used in the conversion process.

    <Task-Dependent_conversion>
    3. **Dependent Conversion:**
        - **Objective:** Convert the current file while ensuring compatibility with dependent files.
        - **Procedure:**
            - Analyze the current file and its dependencies listed in the <Dependency_Tree>.
            - Identify constructs that interact with dependent files and require adaptation.
            - Make sure you follow technology stack as per the <Technology_Stack> provided.
            - Convert the current file, ensuring it remains compatible with the target language.
            - For backend code, implement Swagger documentation for all API endpoints.
            - Review dependent files for any necessary changes to maintain compatibility.
            - Validate the entire set of files for functionality and adherence to best practices.
            - Document changes and potential issues in the code and dependencies.

    5. **Output Requirements:**
        - Return the converted code in the specified format.
        - Ensure the output starts with "```converted" and ends with "```".
        - Include a separate section for dependencies starting with "```dependencies" and ending with "```".

    6. **Validation:**
        - Verify that the converted code maintains the original functionality.
        - Ensure that the code adheres to the best practices and conventions of the target language.
        - For backend code, verify that Swagger documentation is correctly implemented.

    7. **Documentation:**

    Coding practice for language javascript: 
<Code_Generation_Instructions_modular_languages>
    <Instructions>
        1. **Understand Folder Structure:**
            - For Node.js: Place source code in `src/` and assets in `public/`. Use `dist/` for the build output.
            - Organize code using MVC (Model, View, Controller) for backend, with models in `models/`, routes in `routes/`, and controllers in `controllers/`.
            - For front-end JavaScript (React, Angular, etc.), structure components and services in the `src/` directory.

        2. **Adhere to JavaScript Conventions:**
            - Follow **ES6+** features (e.g., `let`, `const`, arrow functions, classes).
            - Use **camelCase** for variable and function names, and **PascalCase** for classes and components.
            - Use **`async`/`await`** for asynchronous programming rather than callbacks or `.then()`/`.catch()`.
            - Avoid using `var`, prefer `let` and `const` to prevent variable hoisting issues.
            - Include **JSDoc** comments for functions, classes, and modules.

        3. **Entry Point Creation:**
            - For Node.js, the entry point is typically `index.js` or `app.js`.
            - In front-end projects like React, use `index.js` to render the React app (`ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))`).
            - Ensure that the entry point aligns with the folder structure.

        4. **Dependency Management:**
            - Use **npm** or **yarn** to manage project dependencies.
            - Ensure that the `package.json` file is up to date with correct dependencies and scripts.
            - If using React, Angular, or other frameworks, include the necessary dependencies (e.g., `react`, `react-dom`, `express`).

        5. **Test Case Integration:**
            - Use **Jest**, **Mocha**, or **Chai** for writing unit and integration tests.
            - Structure tests in a `tests/` or `__tests__/` folder.
            - Use mocks to test API calls or external services.
            - Example test:
                ```javascript
                test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
                    expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(3);
                });
                ```

        6. **Build and Validation:**
            - Use **Webpack** or **Parcel** to bundle the JavaScript for production.
            - Use **Babel** for transpiling ES6+ syntax to ensure compatibility across different browsers.
            - Integrate with **CI/CD** pipelines to automate builds and tests.

        7. **Documentation:**
            - Include inline comments and function-level documentation using **JSDoc**.
            - Create a `README.md` to guide users on setup, usage, and examples.
            - Use **Swagger** or **Postman** for API documentation if working on a Node.js backend.

        8. **Additional Practices:**
            - Modularize the code into smaller reusable functions and components.
            - Keep business logic and UI logic separate in front-end applications.
            - Use error handling, such as `try/catch` blocks and meaningful error messages.

Coding practice for language java: 
<Code_Generation_Instructions_modular_languages>
    <Instructions>
        "Main.java" must be able to access all the the functionality of the code therefore write the code like that.
        1. **Understand Folder Structure:**
            - Use the provided folder structure as a guideline to organize the generated code.
            - Ensure all source code is placed in the appropriate folders (e.g., `src/main/java` for Java, `lib` for Ruby).
            - Place test cases in their designated folders (e.g., `src/test/kotlin` for Kotlin, `tests` for C#).
            - Ensure configuration files are stored in the specified directories (e.g., `resources` for Java, `config` for Ruby).

        2. **Adhere to Language Conventions:**
            - Follow coding standards and best practices specific to the target language.
            - Ensure compatibility with the language's build tools (e.g., Maven for Java, Cargo for Rust).
            - Use idiomatic constructs for the language to enhance code readability and maintainability.

        3. **Entry Point Creation:**
            - Identify and create the required entry point file for the language (e.g., `Main.java` for Java, `main.rs` for Rust).
            - Ensure the entry point aligns with the application logic and folder structure.

        4. **Dependency Management:**
            - Include necessary dependencies as per the language (e.g., `pom.xml` for Java, `pubspec.yaml` for Dart).
            - Verify compatibility of dependencies with the folder structure and target environment.
            - Ensure that configuration files are generated or updated to reflect dependencies.

        5. **Test Case Integration:**
            - Generate unit tests for all critical functionalities.
            - Place test files in the appropriate folders (`src/test/scala` for Scala, `test` for Go).
            - Ensure test cases follow the language's testing framework (e.g., **JUnit** for Java, **NUnit** for C#).
            - For **Java**, include the following libraries:
                - **JUnit** for unit tests: `org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.7.0`
                - **Mockito** for mocking dependencies: `org.mockito:mockito-core:3.8.0`
            - For **C#**, include the **NUnit** framework and **Moq** for mocking.

        6. **Build and Validation:**
            - Ensure the code integrates with the target language's build system (e.g., Gradle for Kotlin, Makefiles for C++).
            - Verify the generated code compiles and executes successfully in its modular environment.
            - Validate that the generated code adheres to coding standards and passes all test cases.

        7. **Documentation:**
            - Include inline comments explaining significant logic or constructs.
            - Provide detailed Swagger documentation for backend APIs.
            - Ensure documentation files are organized in the designated `docs` or equivalent folder.
            - All the classes in the Java must have same name as the File Name. (**MUST**)
            - Ensure that one file has only one class.
            - Ensure that the data types align or use proper casting, e.g., (double) intVariable.
